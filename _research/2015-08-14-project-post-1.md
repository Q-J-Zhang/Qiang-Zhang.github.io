- Hardware design of an underactuated bipedal walking robot with 4 active DOFs and modeling of the prototype’s equivalent multiple rigid links dynamics for the periodic stable off-line gait planning based on Poincáre return mapping method.

- Development of the National Instrument single-board RIO-based control system of the bipedal walking robot, and LabVIEW programming to control the robot walking locomotion at a hung state in an open-loop manner.

- Collaboration on a human-inspired adaptive feedforward control strategy to stabilize the robot’s underactuated bipedal walking locomotion on a compliant ground.
