Q. Zhang, X. H. Xiao*, Y. Wang, et al, “Compliant joint for biped robot considering energy consumption optimization”, Journal of Central South University, 2015, 46(11): 4070-4076. (In Chinese)

In order to optimize the energy consumption of biped robot while walking, the compliant joint for biped walking robots was proposed to investigate the influence of ankle joint and knee joint stiffness on motor torque and energy consumption of the sagittal plane motion during the single support phase. Firstly, an improved model of the five-link biped robot was established, which is the theoretical foundation of the compliant joint. Then, with gait planning based on natural zero moment point (ZMP) trajectory, the robot's center of mass (COM) rack was obtained by setting ZMP trajectory, and the gait on a rigid path was acquired by interpolation. Finally, both the Lagrange equations analytic method and dynamic simulations were performed to analyze the influences of compliant joint stiffness on motor torque and energy consumption based on the improved model of the five-link biped robot. The results show that the compliant joint can reduce the joint motor torque and energy consumption effectively. There is an optimal stiffness of the compliant ankle joint and knee joint respectively, which can minimize the motor energy consumption with a reduction of 89.87% and 90.11% in analytic method, as well as 88.66% and 81.23% in dynamic simulations.
