This paper focuses on the design, modeling, and control of a novel remote actuation, including a compact rotary series elastic actuator (SEA) and Bowden cable. This kind of remote actuation is used for an upper limb rehabilitation robot (ULRR) with four powered degrees of freedom (DOFs). The SEA mainly consists of a DC motor with planetary gearheads, inner/outer sleeves, and eight linearly translational springs. The key innovations include (1) an encoder for direct spring displacement measurement, which can be used to calculate the output torque of SEA equivalently, (2) the embedded springs can absorb the negative impact of backlash on SEA control performance, (3) and the Bowden cable enables long-distance actuation and reduces the bulky structure on the robotic joint. In modeling of this actuation, the SEA's stiffness coefficient, the dynamics of the SEA, and the force transmission of the Bowden cable are considered for computing the inputs on each powered joint of the robot. Then, both torque and impedance controllers consisting of proportional-derivative (PD) feedback, disturbance observer (DOB), and feedforward compensation terms are developed. Simulation and experimental results verify the performance of these controllers. The preliminary results show that this new kind of actuation can not only implement stable and friendly actuation over a long distance but also be customized to meet the requirements of other robotic system design.
